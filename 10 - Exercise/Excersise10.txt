-- 1. Describe in your own words what is meant with candidate key? Which two important properties should a candidate key have
/*
	A candidate key describes all possible attributes from within an table to get selected as primary key.
    It's required for those keys that they contain unqiue values, which means there aren't duplicate values within the different datasets.
    Also, the candidate key must irreducible in regard of getting removed, so no other keys get affected by that choice.
*/

-- 2. Describe two criteria’s for a „good“ Primary Key! Why do they have such a deep impact for us? 
/*
	A primary key should avoid user input. So that those cannot be changed afterwards.
    A primrary key should have a basic structrue, e.g. single digits. What makes it later easier for the programming part.
    
*/

-- 3. Explain in your own words what a Foreign Key is and why do we need this attribute for our referential integrity? 
/*
	A foreign key is literally a placeholder, which leads to an actually primary key from antoher table(relation)
	The reference integrity plays an big role for foreign keys, because all foreign keys must reference in-all cases to a valid value.
*/

-- 4. Example cases (referential integrity)
-- a. You want to insert a dataset into person. In the attribute ortID you want to insert “12”
-- Will be denied.

-- b. You want to update a dataset into person. In the attribute ortID you want to insert “16”!  
-- Will be denied.

-- c. You want to change the ID 8 to 12 from ort.
-- Will be denied.

-- d. You want to delete the ID 1 from ort.
-- ON RESTRICT will be denied 
-- ON CASCADES all values connected to that foreign key will be removed (domino effect)

-- 5. Describe which settings can be used while creating a Foreign Key. Discuss the Dis- and Advantages!
/*
	RESTRICTED - Generally forbid any changes or removals, if they are set on UPDATE OR DELETE.
    CASCADES - Highly dangerous, because it can cause a permanent loss of data and cant be recovered any more. Cascade allows to remove any bound dataset at once.
*/

-- 6. Describe which impact the setting NULLIFY causes! 
/*
	If you decides for NULLIFY, so you can delete an primary key so on all foreign keys will now be removed and replaced with a NULL values
    To keep the integrity of your DKMS alive. The disadvanges you have now, is to deal with NULL values which have to be considered in your queries.
